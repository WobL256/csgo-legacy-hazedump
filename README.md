# The most up-to-date hazedump of CS:GO

This dump has been made on **May 30th 2024**,
quite a while after the last update the game has
received in April 2023 so it should be all good
for some time. 

You could also get hazedump and do it yourself
but if you're that lazy to not do that, that's 
why I created this repo for you ;)

Please note that I will not be updating the dumps
found on this repo, maybe only if I randomly
happen to dump it again. So please check the
last update on the file you're about to use
because it may become outdated (even tho I highly
doubt that because the game isn't getting
updates anymore).
